  abstract  = {Cloud computing is a recent trend in computer science. However, privacy concerns and a lack of trust in cloud providers are an obstacle for many deployments. Maturing hardware support for implementing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) aims at mitigating these problems. Such technologies allow to run applications in a trusted environment, thereby protecting data from unauthorized access. To reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities, code executed inside a TEE should have a minimal Trusted Codebase. As a consequence, there is a trend for partitioning application's logic in trusted and untrusted parts. Only the trusted parts are executed inside the TEE handling the privacy-sensitive processing steps.In this paper, we add a transparent encryption layer to ZooKeeper by means of a privacy proxy supposed to run inside a TEE. We show what measures are necessary to split an application into a trusted and an untrusted part in order to protect the data stored inside, with Zoo-Keeper as an example. With our solution, ZooKeeper can be deployed at untrusted cloud providers, establishing confidential coordination for distributed applications. With our privacy proxy, all ZooKeeper functionality is retained while there is little degradation of throughput.},

  abstract  = {The cloud computing paradigm enables the flexible and scalable outsourcing of workloads. However, cloud customers are often reluctant to entrust their sensitive data with cloud providers. This is due to the fact that the infrastructure is owned by another company and a resulting loss of control. With the recent advent of powerful ARM hardware targeted for data centres, there is the opportunity of using trusted execution technology provided by ARM TrustZone to enhance the protection of cloud customer's data.In this paper we propose TrApps, a secure platform for general-purpose trusted execution in an untrusted cloud with multiple isolated tenants based on the ARM TrustZone technology. Our system targets the parallel execution of partitioned applications of distinct tenants with lean security-sensitive components, and is based on a minimal trusted code base in the secure world of ARM TrustZone when compared to similar systems. In our evaluation we show the feasibility of our approach, and demonstrate its performance with trusted execution of memcached with an overhead of only 36.9% compared to the vanilla implementation and execution.},

  abstract  = {TrustZone-based Real-time Kernel Protection (TZ-RKP) is a novel system that provides real-time protection of the OS kernel using the ARM TrustZone secure world. TZ-RKP is more secure than current approaches that use hypervisors to host kernel protection tools. Although hypervisors provide privilege and isolation, they face fundamental security challenges due to their growing complexity and code size. TZ-RKP puts its security monitor, which represents its entire Trusted Computing Base (TCB), in the TrustZone secure world; a safe isolated environment that is dedicated to security services. Hence, the security monitor is safe from attacks that can potentially compromise the kernel, which runs in the normal world. Using the secure world for kernel protection has been crippled by the lack of control over targets that run in the normal world. TZ-RKP solves this prominent challenge using novel techniques that deprive the normal world from the ability to control certain privileged system functions. These functions are forced to route through the secure world for inspection and approval before being executed. TZ-RKP's control of the normal world is non-bypassable. It can effectively stop attacks that aim at modifying or injecting kernel binaries. It can also stop attacks that involve modifying the system memory layout, e.g, through memory double mapping. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of TZ-RKP, which has gone through rigorous and thorough evaluation of effectiveness and performance. It is currently deployed on the latest models of the Samsung Galaxy series smart phones and tablets, which clearly demonstrates that it is a practical real-world system.},

  abstract  = {ARM TrustZone, a security extension that provides a secure world, a trusted execution environment (TEE), to run security-sensitive code, has been widely adopted in mobile platforms. With the increasing momentum of ARM64 being adopted in server markets like cloud, it is likely to see TrustZone being adopted as a key pillar for cloud security. Unfortunately, TrustZone is not designed to be virtualizable as there is only one TEE provided by the hardware, which prevents it from being securely shared by multiple virtual machines (VMs). This paper conducts a study on variable approaches to virtualizing TrustZone in virtualized environments and then presents vTZ, a solution that securely provides each guest VM with a virtualized guest TEE using existing hardware. vTZ leverages the idea of separating functionality from protection by maintaining a secure co-running VM to serve as a guest TEE, while using the hardware TrustZone to enforce strong isolation among guest TEEs and the untrusted hypervisor. Specifically, vTZ uses a tiny monitor running within the physical TrustZone that securely interposes and virtualizes memory mapping and world switching. vTZ further leverages a few pieces of protected, self-contained code running in a Constrained Isolated Execution Environment (CIEE) to provide secure virtualization and isolation among multiple guest TEEs. We have implemented vTZ on Xen 4.8 on both ARMv7 and ARMv8 development boards. Evaluation using two common TEE-kernels (secure kernel running in TEE) such as seL4 1 and OP-TEE shows that vTZ provides strong security with small performance overhead.},

  abstract  = {Mobile devices are frequently used as terminals to interact with many security-critical services such as mobile payment and online banking. However, the large client software stack and the continuous proliferation of malware expose such interaction under various threats, including passive attacks like phishing and active ones like direct code manipulation. This paper proposes TrustUI, a new trusted path design for mobile devices that enables secure interaction between end users and services based on ARM's TrustZone technology. TrustUI is built with a combination of key techniques including cooperative randomization of the trusted path and secure delegation of network interaction. With such techniques, TrustUI not only requires no trust of the commodity software stack, but also takes a step further by excluding drivers for user-interacting devices like touch screen from its trusted computing base (TCB). Hence, TrustUI has a much smaller TCB, requires no access to device driver code, and may easily adapt to many devices. A prototype of TrustUI has been implemented on a Samsung Exynos 4412 board and evaluation shows that TrustUI provides strong protection of users interaction.},

  abstract  = {Two-factor authentication has been widely used due to the vulnerabilities associated with traditional text-based password. One-time password (OTP) plays an indispensable role on authenticating mobile users to critical web services that demand a high level of security. As the smartphones are increasingly gaining popularity nowadays, software-based OTP generators have been developed and installed into smartphones as software apps, which bring great convenience to the users without introducing extra burden. However, software-based OTP solutions cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the generated passwords or even the seeds when the mobile OS is compromised. Moreover, they also suffer from denial-of-service attacks when the mobile OS crashes. Hardware-based OTP tokens can solve these security problems in the software-based OTP solutions; however, it is inconvenient for the users to carry physical tokens with them, particularly, when there are more than one token to be carried. In this paper, we present TrustOTP, a secure one-time password solution that can achieve both the flexibility of software tokens and the security of hardware tokens by using ARM TrustZone technology. TrustOTP can not only protect the confidentiality of the OTPs against a malicious mobile OS, but also guarantee reliable OTP generation and trusted OTP display when the mobile OS is compromised or even crashes. It is flexible to integrate multiple OTP algorithms and instances for different application scenarios on the same smartphone platform without modifying the mobile OS. We develop a prototype of TrustOTP on Freescale i.MX53 QSB. The experimental results show that TrustOTP has small impacts on the mobile OS and its power consumption is low.},

  abstract  = {Software developers face a number of challenges when creating applications that attempt to keep important data confidential. Even with diligent attention paid to correct software design and implementation practices, secrets can still be exposed through a single flaw in any of the privileged code on the platform, code which may have been written by thousands of developers from hundreds of organizations throughout the world. Intel is developing innovative security technology which provides the ability for software developers to maintain control of the security of sensitive code and data by creating trusted domains within applications to protect critical information during execution and at rest. This paper will describe how this technology has been effectively used in lab exercises to protect private information in applications including enterprise rights management, video chat, trusted financial transactions, and others. Examples will include both protection of local processing and the establishment of secure communication with cloud services. It will illustrate useful software design patterns that can be followed to create many additional types of trusted software solutions.},

Since these fingerprints provide the malware a chance to split its behavior depending on whether the analysis system is present or not, existing analysis systems are not sufficient to analyze the sophisticated malware. In this paper, we propose NINJA, a transparent malware analysis framework on ARM platform with low artifacts. NINJA leverages a hardware-assisted isolated execution environment Trust-Zone to transparently trace and debug a target application with the help of Performance Monitor Unit and Embedded Trace Macrocell. NINJA does not modify system software and is OS-agnostic on ARM platform. We implement a prototype of NINJA (i.e., tracing and debugging subsystems), and the experiment results show that NINJA is efficient and transparent for malware analysis.},

  abstract  = {Network applications and protocols are increasingly adopting security and privacy features, as they are becoming one of the primary requirements. The wide-spread use of transport layer security (TLS) and the growing popularity of anonymity networks, such as Tor, exemplify this trend. Motivated by the recent movement towards commoditization of trusted execution environments (TEEs), this paper explores alternative design choices that application and protocol designers should consider. In particular, we explore the possibility of using Intel SGX to provide security and privacy in a wide range of network applications. We show that leveraging hardware protection of TEEs opens up new possibilities, often at the benefit of a much simplified application/protocol design. We demonstrate its practical implications by exploring the design space for SGX-enabled software-defined inter-domain routing, peer-to-peer anonymity networks (Tor), and middleboxes. Finally, we quantify the potential overheads of the SGX-enabled design by implementing it on top of OpenSGX, an open source SGX emulator.},

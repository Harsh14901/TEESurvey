    Nowadays, there is a trend to design complex, yet
    secure systems. In this context, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) was designed to enrich the previously defined trusted
    platforms. TEE is commonly known as an isolated processing
    environment in which applications can be securely executed
    irrespective of the rest of the system. Although this technology has remained relatively underground since its inception, over the past years, numerous initiatives
    have significantly advanced the state of the art involving TEE(s). Motivated by this revival of interest, this paper presents an in-depth study of the existing use cases of the Trusted Execution Environments covering domains ranging from industry to academia. Furthermore, we analyze the most relevant weaknesses of existing systems and try to draw a comparison between them.

\section{Introduction}
% This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX.
% Please observe the conference page limits. 
User requirements for security are increasingly becoming
demanding. New challenges arise, since modern systems are
becoming more and more complex, open and connected. Traditional security technologies can no longer meet the security
requirements of such architectures. This explains the recent
trend to integrate trusted computing concepts into different
systems. The academia and industry are giving in their best efforts to make the world a more secure place by introducing security features in such systems.\\ \\
Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) is one such technology introduced for enhancing the security of systems to allow greater data protection and reduce dependability on the surrounding environment. Typically, a TEE is divided into two segments a normal world and a secure world. The normal world is unprotected and not secure, whereas the design of TEE guarantees that the applications (called enclaves) running inside the secure world are affected by the intentions of the normal world. The protection mechanisms placed inside the secure world ensure that enclaves are not only isolated from the outside world but are also isolated from each other inside the secure world. This is what makes TEE(s) so popular. \\

Although the technology is remarkable in providing secure execution environments, it was not put in much use in real life projects due to its closed nature. As a result, for
nearly ten years, TEE(s) were mostly used by device manufacturers for monetizing proprietary
secure services, the security of which was difficult to examine due to their closed nature. Yet, over the past few years, we have witnessed a growing interest in TEE(s) from both
academia and industry. TEE(s) have been leveraged in many academic research projects and
commercial products alike, providing the security foundations for systems.\\

TEE(s) have been utilized in several domains to improve the security of systems. Several implementations have been proposed for each domain that utilizes different technologies and serves a different purpose. Given that there are no conflicting tradeoffs between several implementations, they can be integrated together to serve a greater purpose and provide more secure systems than ever before. This can be possible only when we have a comprehensive list of all the implementations in a domain with associated technologies used and purpose served along with certain limitations that can be used for tradeoff analysis. We believe this approach can enable any system developer to analyse the various approaches before choosing a single one of them to allow an efficient and secure system design.\\

In this paper we survey the use cases of TEE(s) that have been in literature and present a comparative analysis for each domain of use. We have identified the following domains in which TEE(s) were implemented (which by no means is exhaustive) and utilized for solving a problem in the domain.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cloud and Edge Computing
    \item Hypervisor and virtualization
    \item Mobile security
    \item OS and kernel security
    \item IoT/Embedded system security
    \item Trusted services
    \item Miscellanous
\end{itemize}

In each of the section below we list the researches that have utilised TEE in the domain and a brief description along with their advantages and disadvantages.


\section{Cloud and Edge Computing}
The recent edge computing infrastructure introduces a new computing model that works as a complement
of the traditional cloud computing. The edge nodes in the
infrastructure reduce the network latency and increase data privacy.
Application of TEEs on the edge nodes would
be a natural choice to secure the computation and sensitive data
on these nodes.
\subsection{Preliminary Study of Trusted Execution Environments on Heterogeneous Edge Platforms }
\cite{cloud1} It investigates the typical hardware assisted TEEs and evaluates the performance of these TEEs to help analyze the feasibility of deploying them on the edge platforms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} Deployment of TEEs can improve the security of computations on edge platforms. Although there is a performance overhead involved but with recent hardware assisted TEEs it would not be substantial.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The research claims that there is a certain performance overhead in deploying TEEs to edge computing platforms. This performance depends on the hardware used.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{VC3: Trustworthy Data Analytics in the Cloud using SGX }
\cite{cloud2} The research proposes a system that allows users to run distributed MapReduce computations in the cloud while keeping their code and data secret, and ensuring the correctness and completeness of their results.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} VC3 relies on SGX processors to isolate memory regions on individual computers, and to deploy new protocols that secure distributed MapReduce computations. VC3 optionally enforces region self-integrity invariants for all MapReduce code running within isolated regions, to prevent attacks due to unsafe memory reads and writes.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} VC3â€™s average runtime overhead: $4.5\%$ with write integrity and $8\%$ with read/write integrity.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Shielding Applications from an Untrusted Cloud with Haven }
\cite{cloud3} Haven, is the first system to achieve shielded execution of unmodified legacy applications, including SQL Server and Apache, on a commodity OS (Windows) and commodity hardware.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} It introduces the notion of shielded execution, which protects the confidentiality and integrity of a program and its data from the platform on which it runs. Haven leverages the hardware protection of Intel SGX to defend against privileged code and physical attacks such as memory probes.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The trusted computing base (TCB) of Haven is substantial, because the LibOS includes a large subset of Windows. Haven does not currently prevent rollback of filesystem state beyond the enclaveâ€™s lifetime. Our prototype relies on the host for system time and timeouts. However, a malicious host may lie about the time or signal timeouts early.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Running ZooKeeper Coordination Services in Untrusted Clouds }
\cite{cloud4} This research adds a transparent encryption layer to ZooKeeper by means of a privacy proxy supposed to run inside a TEE.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} ZooKeeper can be deployed at untrusted cloud providers, establishing confidential coordination for distributed applications. With our privacy proxy, all ZooKeeper functionality is retained while there is little degradation of throughput.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The current solution still allows the inference of usage details based on client access patterns and the znode hierarchy.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{A Cloud based Dual-Root Trust Model for Secure Mobile Online Transactions }
\cite{cloud5} This paper proposes a a dual-root trust online transaction model that provides a dual-root trust model including both the userâ€™s mobile device and a delegation mobile cloud using  a modified CP-ABE cryptography

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} In this approach, most cryptographic functions are delegated from users to the mobile cloud, making it a lightweight scheme for mobile devices
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Practical Privacy Preserving Cloud Resource-Payment for Constrained Clients}
\cite{cloud6} This paper aims to tackle the issue of privacy in Cloud Computing by providing a method which allows clients to anonymously consume resources of a Cloud Provider (CP) such that the CP is not able to track usersâ€™ activity patterns

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The proposed method used prepad tokens that work as credits that are transfarable between trusted parties. Thus privacy is maintained even while buying the credits.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The test code, support libraries and JavaVM are way too large to fit into a TrustZone environment
\end{itemize}


\subsection{DFCloud : A TPM-based Secure Data Access Control Method of Cloud Storage in Mobile Devices }
\cite{cloud7} This research proposes DFCloud, a secure data access control method of cloud storage services based on Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to manage all the encryption keys and define a key sharing protocol among legal users.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} DFCloud is secure by design as it uses client-based encryption method to guarantee that server-side data leakage cannot occur. It also performs remote attestation on each client to prevent data or credential leakages caused by malicious programs in client-side, before a data encryption key is used.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The performance overhead for transfering files with secure world encryption is quite high as compared to alternative platforms (about twice for 4 kB files).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{ARM TrustZone for Secure Image Processing on the Cloud }
\cite{cloud8} The research implementes Darkroom, a secure image processing service for the cloud leveraging ARM TrustZone technology. It stores image data in encrypted form and uses TrustZone-enabled ARM processors to securely process such images in isolation from the operating system

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The system enables users to securely process image data in a secure environment that prevents exposure of sensitive data to the operating system
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The solution adds a small overhead to image processing when compared to computer platforms that require the entire operating system to be trusted.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{TrApps: Secure Compartments in the Evil Cloud }
\cite{cloud9} The research proposes TrApps, a secure platform for general purpose trusted execution in an untrusted cloud with multiple isolated tenants based on the ARM TrustZone technology

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The system targets the parallel execution of partitioned applications of distinct tenants with lean security-sensitive components, and is based on a minimal trusted code base in the secure world of ARM TrustZone when compared to similar systems
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} On average, usage of TrApps imposes an overhead of $36.9\%$ on Secure Memcached. Equally, the network traffic of Secure Memcached is lower, as less requests are transmitted per second.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypervisor and Virtualization}

\subsection{Towards a TrustZone-assisted Hypervisor for Real Time Embedded Systems}
This letter presents the implementation of a TrustZone-based hypervisor for real time embedded systems, which allows multiple RTOS partitions on the same hardware platform.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} This work surpasses related work by implementing a TrustZone-assisted solution that allows the execution of an arbitrary number of guest OSes while providing the foundation to drive next generation of secure virtualization solutions for resource-constrained embedded devices.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Evaluations demonstrated that virtualization overhead has a slight impact on execution performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{T-KVM: A Trusted architecture for KVM ARM v7 and v8 Virtual Machines Securing Virtual Machines by means of KVM, TrustZone, TEE and SELinux}
In this paper, Trusted Kernel-based Virtual Machine (T-KVM), a novel security architecture for the KVM-on-ARM hypervisor, is proposed to satisfy the current market trend The proposed architecture combines four isolation layers: ARM Virtualization and Security Extensions (also known as ARM VE and TrustZone), GlobalPlatform Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) APIs and SELinux Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security policy.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} T-KVM integrates software and hardware components to secure guest Operating Systems (OSes) and enable Trusted Computing in ARM virtual machines.  The T-KVM architecture can be implemented on platforms based on ARM v7 and v8 architectures, without requiring additional custom hardware extensions.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The different isolation layers which compose T-KVM provide high security, but at a cost of additional overhead.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{ÂµRTZVisor: A Secure and Safe Real-Time Hypervisor}
In this paper, we present ÂµRTZVisor as a new TrustZone-assisted hypervisor that distinguishes itself from state-of-the-art TrustZone solutions by implementing a microkernel-like architecture while following an object-oriented approach.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} ÂµRTZVisor is able to run nearly unmodified guest OSes, while, contrarily to existing TrustZone-assisted solutions, it provides a high degree of functionality and configurability, placing strong emphasis on the real-time support.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The more partitions there are in a system, the bigger the latency for the response would be.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{LTZVisor: TrustZone is the Key}
In this paper we present a Lightweight TrustZoneassisted Hypervisor (LTZVisor) as a tool to understand, evaluate and discuss the benefits and limitations of using TrustZone hardware to assist virtualization
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} We demonstrate how TrustZone can be adequately exploited for meeting the real-time needs, while presenting a low performance cost on running unmodified rich operating systems.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} One of the main identified limitations is related to the number of supported virtual machines. LTZVisor supports the coexistence of two VMs, one running in the secure world and one running in the non-secure world.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Reconciling Security with Virtualization: A Dual-Hypervisor Design for ARM TrustZone}
This paper proposes a novel design to enable the virtualization of both secure and non-secure worlds offered by ARM platforms with TrustZone technology.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The design is based on a dual-hypervisor scheme that allows executing multiple twoworld domains in isolation, where each of them can comprise both a standard (i.e., non-secure) execution environment, and a trusted execution environment (TEE).
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The major latencies introduced by the realized implementation are due to the bootstrap phase of the X Monitor, the world switches, and the crossing of the virtualization layers of the two hypervisors
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Asymmetric Virtualisation for Real-Time Systems}
This paper describes how an asymmetric virtualisation layer has been realised on top of the ARM TrustZone security extension, in order to support the concurrent execution of both a real-time and a general purpose operating system on the same processor.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} It introduces a very small overhead because it does not require privileged instruction emulation. The practical feasibility of this approach has been further remarked by the implementation of a VMM prototype and the overhead introduced by virtualisation has been measured with encouraging results
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The only limitation posed on the operating system hosted on the non-secure side is that it can no longer use the TrustZone features by itself.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{vTZ: Virtualizing ARM TrustZone}
This paper conducts a study on variable approaches to virtualizing TrustZone in virtualized environments and then presents vTZ, a solution that securely provides each guest VM with a virtualized guest TEE using existing hardware.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} vTZ leverages the idea of separating functionality from protection by maintaining a secure co-running VM to serve as a guest TEE, while using the hardware TrustZone to enforce strong isolation among guest TEEs and the untrusted hypervisor. vTZ further leverages Constrained Isolated Execution Environments (CIEEs) in the normal world to virtualize the functionality of TrustZone.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Lightweight Multicore Virtualization Architecture exploiting ARM TrustZone}
This work presents the extension of a TrustZone-assisted hypervisor to an asymmetric multi-processing configuration. We describe and demonstrate how to run a general-purpose operating system side-by-side with an real-time operating system
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The achieved results demonstrate that the implemented multicore approach not only completely eliminates starvation, but also increases the general-purpose operating systemâ€™s performance, especially when the real-time workload is demanding
    \item \textbf{Limitations:}Current solution is limited to the one-to-one mapping between cores, guests and worlds
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Towards a lightweight embedded virtualization architecture exploiting ARM TrustZone.}
This work in progress paper presents the implementation of an embedded virtualization architecture through commodity hardware.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} ARM TrustZone technology is exploited to implement a lightweight virtualization solution with low overhead and high determinism, corroborated by promising preliminary results.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{VOSYSmonitor, a Low Latency Monitor Layer for Mixed-Criticality Systems on ARMv8-A}
this paper presents VOSYSmonitor, a multi-core software layer, which allows the co-execution of a safety-critical Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and a noncritical General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) on the same hardware ARMv8-A platform
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} VOSYSmonitor main differentiation factors with the known solutions is the possibility for a processor to switch between secure and non-secure code execution at runtime. The partitioning is ensured by the ARM TrustZone technology, thus allowing to preserve the usage of virtualization features for the GPOS.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} However, only one safety critical RTOS can be executed with the current implementation. VOSYSmonitor lacks of a way to take back the control if the Secure world OS does not release the core resource
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Dual Operating System Architecture for Real-Time Embedded Systems}
This paper presents a dual operating system virtualization architecture that supports integrated scheduling to enhance the responsiveness of the GPOS while preserving the determinism of the RTOS.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The proposed approach takes advantage of common embedded security hardware (ARM TrustZoneR ) to improve the reliability and isolation of the RTOS with low overhead and no modifications to the GPOS core.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Further, our current implementation focuses on data caches (but could be extended to apply to instruction caches) and cannot detect if samples were disturbed by the processing of non-maskable interrupts
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Dual-OS Infrastructure for Mixed-Criticality Systems on ARMv8 Platforms}
In this paper, we propose and test a Dual-OS environment for Mixed-Criticality systems using ARM devices, by exploiting latest architecture changes and software advancements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} Through architecture technologies such as TrustZone and a proper firmware layer like ATF, two completely independent and isolated OS instances can be run simultaneously on the same hardware resources.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Affordable Separation on Embedded Platforms}
we investigate an approach in which a few minor hardware additions together with virtualization offer protected execution in embedded systems while still allowing non-virtualized execution when secure services are not needed
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}Integrity and privacy of trusted guests are maintained at all times: while virtualization is active (in protected mode), while it is not (in normal mode), and while the machine is powered off.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The main costs for enabling isolated services consists of their decryption and the integrity check of those services and of the lightweight hypervisor.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SPACE AND TIME PARTITIONING WITH HARDWARE SUPPORT FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS}
Describes a real time hypervisor for space applications assisted by commercial off-the-shell (COTS) hardware.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}The secure hypervisor is flexible enough to run unmodified guest OSes at higher performance, while guaranteeing strong isolation between guests, with more than $99\%$ performance for a 10 milliseconds guest-switching rate
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} In spite of using a multicore hardware architecture, the current implementation only supports a single-core configuration
\end{itemize}





\section{OS and Kernel security}

\subsection{Hypervision Across Worlds: Real-time Kernel Protection from the ARM TrustZone Secure World}
The research proposes TrApps, a secure platform for generalpurpose trusted execution in an untrusted cloud with multiple isolated tenants based on the ARM TrustZone technology

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} Normal world functions are forced to route through the secure world for inspection and approval before being executed. TZ-RKPâ€™s control of the normal world is non-bypassable. It can effectively stop attacks that aim at modifying or injecting kernel binaries. It can also stop attacks that involve modifying the system memory layout.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} A better performance is achievable when the number of monitored events is reduced.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SPROBES: Enforcing Kernel Code Integrity on the TrustZone Architecture}
SPROBES, a novel primitive that enables introspection of operating systems running on ARM TrustZone hardware.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} Using SPROBES, an introspection mechanism protected by TrustZone can instrument individual operating system instructions of its choice, receiving an unforgeable trap whenever any SPROBE is executed. we identify a set of five invariants whose enforcement is sufficient to restrict rootkits to execute only approved, SPROBE-injected kernel code.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Since smartphone boot-times can be performance-critical, SPROBES overhead may be an issue.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{On-board Credentials with Open Provisioning}
We describe how we use general-purpose secure hardware to develop an architecture for credentials which we call On-board Credentials (ObCs).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} ObCs combine the flexibility of virtual credentials with the higher levels of protection due to the use of secure hardware. A distinguishing feature of the ObC architecture is that it is open: it allows anyone to design and deploy new credential algorithms to ObC-capable devices without approval from the device manufacturer or any other third party.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Techniques for determining and describing the level of security in the secure environment on the target device are needed. the provisioning server needs ways to specify policies on how the provisioned credentials are to be accessed and used locally on the target device. the security and the usability of ObC system need to be more rigorously validated.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The ANDIX Research OS - ARM TrustZone Meets Industrial Control Systems Security}
introduces ANDIX OS, a security Operating System using the ARM TrustZone architecture to create a Trusted Execution Environment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} ANDIX OS can assign peripherals solely to the secure world, thus isolating these peripherals from the normal world. ANDIX OSâ€™s architecture minimizes the components responsible for creating the TEE thus reducing the attack surface.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} sharing device drivers between secure and normal worlds has significant overhead as their states need to be stored and transmitted too.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mobile system security}

\subsection{TrustICE: Hardware-assisted Isolated Computing Environments on Mobile Devices}

TrustZonebased isolation framework named TrustICE to create isolated computing environments (ICEs) in the normal domain. TrustICE securely isolates the secure code in an ICE from an untrusted Rich OS in the normal domain
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The trusted computing base (TCB) of TrustICE remains small and unchanged regardless of the amount of secure code being protected. the switching time between an ICE and the Rich OS is less than 12 ms.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} for the CPU and I/O devices, we have to rely on the careful design of TDC to clean up the CPU states and control the interrupts for the ICEs. However, when one ICE is running in the normal domain, it cannot access other ICEsâ€™ memory spaces that are protected by the watermark region, which can only be configured by TDC in the secure domain.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Enhancing the Security of Mobile Applications by using TEE and (U)SIM}
This paper presents a security architecture and a novel mobile payment and multimedia content playback solution leveraging on the existing post-paid billing method
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} addresses some of the security problems and lack of trust in Android ecosystem due to rooting and re-flashing with custom software. It provides an additional layer of security binding such that the trust worthiness of a mobile phone is removed once it is rooted or re-flashed.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Building Trusted Path on Untrusted Device Drivers for Mobile Devices}
This paper proposes TrustUI, a new trusted path design for mobile devices that enables secure interaction between end users and services based on ARMâ€™s TrustZone technology
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} TrustUI takes a step further by excluding drivers for user-interacting devices like touch screen from its trusted computing base (TCB). So, it has a much smaller TCB, requires no access to device driver code, and may easily adapt to many devices.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Doesn't support multiple secure applications and introduce a tiny sandbox mechanism to isolate them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trustworthy Execution on Mobile Devices: What security properties can my mobile platform give me?}

analyze why widely-deployed hardware security primitives on mobile device platforms are inaccessible to application developers and end-users and show how modifications to existing proposals can strengthen the security properties available.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} strengthens the security properties available to applications and users without reducing the properties currently enjoyed by OEMs and network carriers
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Untapped Potential of Trusted Execution Environments on Mobile Devices}
this article discusses why TEEs are so widely deployed in mobile devices, and what kind of capabilities they support
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The hardware-security APIs have been modeled after usage paradigms of hardware security modules(HSMs), cryptographic tokens and smart cards, and allow creation of hardware-protected keys, and common cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signatures, on them.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Its not clear how secrets collected and amassed in a trusted application are migrated to a new device when the user updates his device
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Using ARM TrustZone to Build a Trusted Language Runtime for Mobile Applications}

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Trusted Language Runtime (TLR), a system that protects the confidentiality and integrity of .NET mobile applications from OS security breaches.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The main benefit of the TLR is to bring the developer benefits of managed code to trusted computing. With the TLR, developers can build their trusted components with the productivity benefits of modern high-level languages, such as strong typing and garbage collection.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The TLR is  statically allocated a portion of the device RAM by the bootloader itself. This might lead to wastage of precious resources as the memory cannot be reclaimed when not in use by the TrustZone.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Inspecting data from the safety of your trusted execution environment.}

This paper presents a proof of concept that uses ARM TrustZone to perform introspection of a Linux kernel running in the normal world from within a secure-world system
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} enumerates the steps necessary for taking advantage of existing volatile memory analysis techniques to be employed in the creation of a custom application that implements validation of the normal world system call table
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Writing to the normal world from the secure world is implemented but untested.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Regulating ARM TrustZone Devices in Restricted Spaces}

This paper develops mechanisms that allow hosts to analyze and regulate ARM TrustZone-based guest devices using remote memory operations.  In our approach, restricted space hosts use remote memory operations to analyze and regulate guest devices within the restricted space
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} We show that the ARM TrustZone allows our approach to obtain strong security guarantees while only requiring a small trusted computing base to execute on guest devices.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:}There are questions about its adoptability in real-world settings that remain to be answered
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Retrofitting the Partially Privileged Mode for TEE Communication Channel Protection}

We therefore propose the TEE defense (TFence) framework that enables the creation of a partially privileged (par-priv) process, which benefits from the coordination of the system mode and virtualization extension. More specifically, on ARM architecture, direct invocation of hypercall and SMC is not allowed in the user process
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}This approach enabled us to remove the kernel dependency when the process communicates with the TEE, which also reduces the attack surface to the critical part of the application involved in the communication. Besides, direct communication with the hypervisor facilitates the adoption of application-shielding approaches to protect the critical part and to restrict arbitrary access to the TEE.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:}TFence consistently imposes overhead on the overall system owing to the hypervisor activation, which is around $6\%$ with LMBench
\end{itemize}


\section{IoT/embedded system security}


\subsection{Software Abstractions for Trusted Sensors}
This paper proposes two software abstractions for offering trusted sensors to mobile applications and the implementation of these abstractions on both x86 and ARM platforms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} tries to overcome the privacy challenges posed by trusted sensors. Demonstrates how differential privacy can be used with a GPS sensor to improve privacy.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Trusted Computing Building Blocks for Embedded Linux-based ARM TrustZone Platforms}
This paper outlines an approach to merge TCG-style Trusted Computing concepts with ARM TrustZone technology in order to build an open Linux-based embedded trusted computing platform
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} debugging of the user-space supervisor process for the non-secure world VM is relatively straightforward in comparison to purely kernel-base virtualisation approaches.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The secure-world Linux prototype implementation supports two different in-kernel handling mechanisms for secure monitor calls originating in non-secure world. However these lowlevel in-kernel monitor call handlers are restricted as they must not perform any actions which might sleep or cause a secureworld task switch.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Secure device access for automotive software}
proposes a secure automotive software platform that has secure device access method with TrustZone
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} This approach restricts a direct access of the extension software and also supports multicore processors. In addition, the measured overhead is reduced by less than $1\%$ degradation, and the maximum bandwidth of device access is achieved up to 5MB/s.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Inter Processor Interrupt (IPI) is restricted in TrustZone. Secure world can send IPI to any world in any core, but normal world can send IPI to only normal world, not secure world.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{PROTC: PROTeCting droneâ€™s peripherals through ARM TrustZone}
This paper proposes a new mechanism PROTC to protect the essential peripherals of a drone from being maliciously accessed. The protection is abstracted through the feature of ARM TrustZone.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} PROTC ensures the droneâ€™s safety and important dataâ€™s integrity even when the droneâ€™s OS is compromised and also allows the installation of third-party applications easily
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Some malicious critical applications could have malicious proxy that compromises drone normal world OS by leveraging rootkits
\end{itemize}


\subsection{FreeTEE: When real-time and security meet}
presents FreeTEE, an embedded architecture that emphasizes and preserves the real-time properties of the system but still guarantees security from the outset
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} This approach preserves the realTime properties of the system and still guarantees security from the outset and only a small overhead on latency is induced.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} As FreeTEE is a single-core implemenation, the GPOS only runs when there is no RT ready-to-run task in the system.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Experimenting with ARM TrustZone Or: How I met friendly piece of trusted hardware}
This paper discusses experiences made by the authors with a rather inexpensive development board and shows how system-level development on TrustZone-enabled hardware is possible in class-room settings
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} It integrates with the standard ARM Linux boot process and can be directly invoked from a boot loader like u-boot, also uses less than half of the available I-TCM and D-TCM space leaving 8K of the available D-TCM and 8K of the available I-TCM space for secure-world user applications
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} This approach configures all interrupts as FIQ-type interrupts and redirects them to secure monitor mode. This is problematic as Linux usually does not expect FIQ-type interrupts which requires additional code in secure monitor mode to simulate delivery of an IRQ-type interrupt
\end{itemize}


\subsection{A Private User Data Protection Mechanism in TrustZone Architecture Based on Identity Authentication}
This paper proposes a private user data protection mechanism in TrustZone to avoid user data leakage risk from Client Applications
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}This uses identity verification module to a multi-user TrustZone environment, and establish the correspondence between a data object and its owner to verify the identity of each data access requester. This mechanism guarantees the security of data access, and enhances the protection of usersâ€™ private data.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The communication between the normal world and the secure world employs the default SMC command which is time consuming
\end{itemize}


\subsection{IIoTEED: An Enhanced, Trusted Execution Environment for Industrial IoT Edge Devices}
demonstrates why TrustZone is becoming a reference technology for securing IoT edge devices, and how enhanced Tees can help meet industrial IoT applicationsâ€™ real-time requirements
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}IIoTEED has fully or partially achieved the three fundamental elements of CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. it also reinforces edge device encryption and transport layer security.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} IIoTEED only partially addresses the industrial security puzzle at edge level. To help with end-to-end security while meeting the right tradeoff between security and real-time requirements, it must be extended with other tailored, hardware-assisted security and acceleration strategies
\end{itemize}


\subsection{MIPE: a practical memory integrity protection method in a trusted execution environment}
we propose a practical memory integrity protection method on an ARM-based platform, called MIPE, to defend against security threats including kernel data attacks and direct memory access attacks
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}MIPE utilizes TrustZone technique to create a isolated execution environment, which can protect the sensitive code and data against attacks. To present the integrity protection strategies, we provide the design of MIPE using B method, which is a practical formal methodtion and transport layer security.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Doesn't provide the memory integrity verification by formalization
\end{itemize}


\subsection{CFI CaRE: Hardware-Supported Call and Return Enforcement for Commercial Microcontrollers}
We then present CaRE, the first interrupt-aware CFI scheme for low-end MCUs. CaRE uses a novel way of protecting the CFI metadata by leveraging TrustZone-M security extensions introduced in the ARMv8-M architecture.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}Its binary instrumentation approach preserves the memory layout of the target MCU software, allowing pre-built bare-metal binary code to be protected by CaRE. Leveraging hardware assisted security is an important enabler in CaRE, but it also meets other requirements important for practical deployment on small devices
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:}

          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}


\section{Trusted services}

\subsection{TrustOTP: Transforming Smartphones into Secure One-Time Password Tokens}
TrustOTP, a secure onetime password solution that can achieve both the flexibility of software tokens and the security of hardware tokens by using ARM TrustZone technology.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} TrustOTP can not only protect the confidentiality of the OTPs against a malicious mobile OS, but also guarantee reliable OTP generation and trusted OTP display when the mobile OS is compromised or even crashes. It is flexible to integrate multiple OTP algorithms and instances for different application scenarios on the same smartphone platform without modifying the mobile OS.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} TrustOTP depends on the battery of the smartphone, which needs to be recharged every one or two days. When the smartphone is out of battery, TrustOTP cannot work until being charged by a computer or a power outlet. TrustOTP may suffer from man-in-the-middle attacks when used alone.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{TrustDump: Reliable Memory Acquisition on Smartphones}
TrustZone-based memory acquisition mechanism called TrustDump that is capable of reliably obtaining the RAM memory and CPU registers of the mobile OS even if the OS has crashed or has been compromised.

    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The mobile OS is running in the TrustZoneâ€™s normal domain, and the memory acquisition tool is running in the TrustZoneâ€™s secure domain, which has the access privilege to the memory in the normal domain.  we rely on ARM TrustZone to achieve a hardware-assisted isolation with a small trusted computing base (TCB) of about 450 lines of code.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{E-Pass Using DRM in Symbian v8 OS and TrustZone : Securing Vital Data on Mobile Devices}
This paper addresses the issue of protecting the content of digital media in Symbian OS mobile phones using a secured E-Pass stored on Symbian v8 OS mobile devices
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  The integration of Symbian DRM and Trustzone not only adds another layer of security but also remains transparent to the end user because the data is stored in a secure domain within the operating system. As this security protection happens in the background, user never sees the add-on security and gives no different whatsoever from userâ€™s point of view
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} This would restrict the user's ability to freely install applications.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{A Path Towards Ubiquitous Protection of Media}
This paper outlines a possible approach to enable a Secure Media Path on mobile devices to support the needs of the different stakeholders, with respect to openness, content protection and client privacy.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  Media processing is isolated from the rich OS,  so the interests of the content provider to protect their content from piracy are preserved. At the same time, such software is not able to subvert the security and privacy of the user because it can access the relevant parts of the media pipeline only.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Using Innovative Instructions to Create Trustworthy Software Solutions}
\subsubsection{One-time Password (OTP)}
A simple application that can be created with SGX is a generator of one-time passwords.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  The OTP prototype described here prevents malicious software from gaining access to the OTP pre-shared key, including targeted attacks from malicious software with higher privilege.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Instead of sending the challenge directly to the OTP enclave, the remote service could generate a bitmap containing a visual representation of the challenge code, and encrypt this before sending to the OTP enclave. To harden the solution even further, a trusted input path could be established between an input device and Intelâ€™s Manageability Engine
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Enterprise Rights Management}
we describe an SGX technology-based ERM architecture, focused on document distribution, access control and viewing, that addresses the vulnerabilities found in todayâ€™s ERM systems.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  With SGX technology enabled the application to withstand these attacks and satisfy all its security objectives. The protected document is encrypted within the enclave with a randomly generated key which is stored on the server, and later distributed to authorized IntelÂ® SGX protected document viewers. The encrypted documents themselves need not be stored in the server database. All communication between the server and authenticated clients is encrypted and also offers integrity and replay protection to provide end-to-end security for various use cases.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:} 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Video Conferencing}

\subsection{Trusted Execution Environment-Based Authentication Gauge (TEEBAG)}
Our approach uses existing features and capabilities of TEEs toenhance the security of user authentication.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  We reverse the way traditional authentication schemes work: instead of the user presenting their authentication data to a remote device, we request the remote device to send the stored authentication template(s) to the local device
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} The main challenge is to enable the user to identify or authenticate the trusted application within the device they are using to differentiate it from an impostor
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Secure Block Device - Secure, Flexible, and Efficient Data Storage for ARM TrustZone Systems}
We introduce the Secure Block Device, a secure, easy to use, flexible, efficient, and widely applicable minimal Trusted Computing Base solution to provide data confidentiality and integrity for Data at Rest.

We explore the possibility of using Intel SGX to provide security and privacy in a wide range of network applications.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} leveraging hardware protection of TEEs opens up new possibilities, often at the benefit of a much simplified application/protocol design. Our design shows that SGX can not only improve the security and privacy of existing applications, but also enable new services
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} However, denialof-service is out of scope; a malicious privilege software could easily crash or halt the system. TEEâ€™s usage has been rather limited due to performance issues.

\subsection{Identity Verification Schemes for Public Transport Ticketing with NFC Phones}
Examines the feasibility of using mobile phone with a TEE for identity verification of transport ticketing with a perspective focusing on security and performance. It uses the On-board Credentials (ObC) architecture as the TEE.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}  confidentiality and integrity of the data exchange is guaranteed by the ObC provisioning protocol. It saves on the time budget considerably as compared to its peers.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} This method aims to reduce the efficacy of MITM attacks, but the threat of a MITM attack is still present. Also this does not provide a trusted receipt of the transaction. Has privacy issues - CA and TA can build a route information profile of a user based on the userâ€™s traveling behaviour.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Using Trusted Execution Environments in Two-factor Authentication: comparing approaches}

examines two TEE technologies, Intelâ€™s IPT and ARM TrustZone, revealing that, although it is possible to get close to classic two-factor authentication in terms of ser interaction security, both technologies have distinct drawbacks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} The model also clearly shows an open problem shared by many TEEs: how to prove to the user that they are dealing with a trusted application when trusted and untrusted applications share the same display
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Intel IPT has a serious issue where there is no trusted input path for the user to enter data. ARM TrustZone requires careful selection of the right components by the system-on-a-chip designer that puts the parts of the TEE together to guarantee that it can be trusted. Both technologies share a common issue, which is how to prove to the user that they are dealing with a trusted application.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Smartphones as Practical and Secure Location Verification Tokens for Payments}

proposes a location-based second-factor authentication solution for modern smartphones making use of TEEs commonly available on modern smartphones.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} the proposed method can be effectively used for the detection of fraudulent transactions caused by card theft or counterfeiting and it also does not require any changes in the user behavior at the point of sale or to the deployed terminals.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:}The card issuer can ask the userâ€™s device for location statements and track the user over time. The card issuer may also abuse the system and query the userâ€™s device for a location statement when the card is not involved in a transaction.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{AdAttester: Secure online mobile advertisement attestation using TrustZone.}

This paper proposes a verifiable mobile ad framework called AdAttester, based on ARMâ€™s TrustZone technology
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} AdAttester provides two novel security primitives, namely unforgeable clicks and verifiable display. The two primitives attest that ad-related operations (e.g., user clicks) are initiated by the end user (instead of a bot) and that the ad is displayed intact and timely.
          % \item \textbf{Limitations:}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SeCReT: Secure Channel between Rich Execution Environment and Trusted Execution Environment}

We propose SeCReT to ameliorate this problem. SeCReT is a framework that builds a secure channel between the REE and TEE by enabling REE processes to use session keys in the REE that is regarded as unsafe region
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} To protect the key, SeCReT interposes with every switch between user mode and kernel mode, verifying the codeâ€™s integrity and the coarse-grained control flow of the process. To minimize the performance overhead, SeCReTâ€™s key-protection mechanism is activated only during the runtime of the process that has permission to access TrustZone
